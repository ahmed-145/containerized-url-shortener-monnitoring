Monitoring a Containerized URL Shortener Webservice

‚∏ª

üí° Project Idea

A small, production-style demo that builds a Node.js (Express) URL shortener, containerizes it with Docker, instruments it with Prometheus custom metrics, and visualizes everything in Grafana.

The goal is to simulate a real DevOps workflow: building, monitoring, alerting, and persisting data across container restarts.

üóÇ Project Plan & Team Roles (initial draft, subject to change)

We are a team of 5. Tasks are distributed as follows (roles may shift during execution):
	‚Ä¢	Ahmed Mahmoud ‚Üí Backend & API development (Express routes, SQLite integration, metrics exposure).
	‚Ä¢	Mohamed Abd ElKader ‚Üí Containerization & Infrastructure (Dockerfile, docker-compose.yml, persistence volumes).
	‚Ä¢	Tasnim ‚Üí Monitoring & Visualization (Prometheus configuration, Grafana dashboards, alerts).
	‚Ä¢	Ahmed Hany ‚Üí Testing & Integration (end-to-end validation, persistence checks, demo preparation).
	‚Ä¢	Mohamed Ashraf ‚Üí Documentation & Delivery (README, API documentation, dashboard exports, presentation).

‚∏ª

üèó Architecture
	‚Ä¢	App: Node.js + Express URL shortener (REST API + redirects)
	‚Ä¢	DB: SQLite (file-based)
	‚Ä¢	Monitoring: Prometheus (scrape) + Grafana (dashboards & alerts)
	‚Ä¢	Orchestration: Docker Compose

‚∏ª

‚ú® Features
	‚Ä¢	POST /shorten ‚Üí returns a short code for a long URL
	‚Ä¢	GET /<code> ‚Üí HTTP 301 redirect to the long URL
	‚Ä¢	/metrics ‚Üí Prometheus metrics (counters + latency histogram)
	‚Ä¢	Grafana dashboards for rates, latency (P95), and 404s
	‚Ä¢	Alerts (e.g. high latency, too many 404s)
	‚Ä¢	Data persists via Docker volumes

üõ† Tech Stack
	‚Ä¢	Node.js (Express)
	‚Ä¢	SQLite
	‚Ä¢	Docker & Docker Compose
	‚Ä¢	Prometheus
	‚Ä¢	Grafana

üìÖ Week-by-Week Plan

Week 1 ‚Äî Build & Containerize
	‚Ä¢	Build Express app with POST /shorten and GET /:code.
	‚Ä¢	Store mappings in SQLite.
	‚Ä¢	Write Dockerfile.
	‚Ä¢	Create initial docker-compose.yml (app only).

Deliverables: Running URL shortener in a container.

‚∏ª

Week 2 ‚Äî Instrumentation with Prometheus
	‚Ä¢	Add Prometheus client to expose metrics at /metrics.
	‚Ä¢	Counters: shortened URLs, redirects, failed lookups.
	‚Ä¢	Histogram for request latency.
	‚Ä¢	Add Prometheus service in docker-compose.yml.
	‚Ä¢	Write prometheus.yml scrape config.

Deliverables: Prometheus shows application metrics.

‚∏ª

Week 3 ‚Äî Grafana Dashboards
	‚Ä¢	Add Grafana to docker-compose.yml.
	‚Ä¢	Connect Grafana to Prometheus as datasource.
	‚Ä¢	Create dashboard panels:
	‚Ä¢	Rate of URL creations & redirects
	‚Ä¢	Total count of shortened links
	‚Ä¢	P95 latency
	‚Ä¢	404 error rate

Deliverables: Real-time Grafana dashboard visualizing service metrics.

‚∏ª

Week 4 ‚Äî Alerts, Persistence & Documentation
	‚Ä¢	Configure Grafana alerts (e.g. high latency, too many 404s).
	‚Ä¢	Add Docker volumes for SQLite, Prometheus, Grafana.
	‚Ä¢	Test persistence after restart.
	‚Ä¢	Write README & API documentation.
	‚Ä¢	Final testing and demo preparation.

Deliverables: Stable system with persistence, alerts, and documentation.
